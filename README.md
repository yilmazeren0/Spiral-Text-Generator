# Spiral-Text-Generator
Just simple JS algorithm that takes a text input and convert it to spiral form. I wrote this code
for an upwork job but client disappered so I want to share it whoever need.

![enter the text part](/textPart.png?raw=true "")
![spiral version of text](/spiral.png?raw=true "")
